# Introduction to DSA

## What is DSA?
- **DSA** stands for **Data Structures and Algorithms**.
- **Data Structure**: A way to store and organize data so it can be used efficiently.
  - Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs.
- **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.
  - Examples: Binary Search, Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort).

## Why Learn DSA?
1. **Efficient Problem Solving**  
   - Helps in writing optimized code that runs faster and uses less memory.

2. **Crucial for Interviews**  
   - Most tech companies test problem-solving skills using DSA questions.

3. **Better Understanding of Programming**  
   - Teaches you how code works internally.

4. **Scalability**  
   - Helps in handling large amounts of data and high-traffic applications.
