# Algorithms & Analysis of Algorithms

## What is an Algorithm?
- A **step-by-step set of instructions** to solve a specific problem.
- Must be:
  1. **Clear** (unambiguous steps)
  2. **Finite** (ends after a limited number of steps)
  3. **Correct** (produces the expected result)

### Example
**Problem:** Find the sum of first `n` natural numbers.

**Algorithm (Step-by-step)**:
1. Start
2. Take input `n`
3. Initialize `sum = 0`
4. For `i = 1` to `n`, do:
   - `sum = sum + i`
5. Print `sum`
6. Stop

**Code Example (JavaScript)**:
```js
function sumOfN(n) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return sum;
}
```

## What is Analysis of Algorithms?
- **Definition**: The process of determining the resources an algorithm uses (time, memory, etc.) as input size grows.
- **Goal**: Measure efficiency and performance before implementing or choosing an algorithm.

## Why is it Necessary?

### 1. Performance Comparison
- Multiple algorithms can solve the same problem; analysis helps choose the most efficient one.

### 2. Scalability Check
- Ensures the solution works for small and large inputs without performance issues.

### 3. Resource Management
- Saves computation time and memory usage.

## Why Analysis Became a Standard Practice
- In early computing, hardware was expensive and slow → Choosing the wrong algorithm wasted valuable resources.
- As data grew larger, brute-force methods became impractical.
- **Standardization**: Big O notation became a universal way to compare algorithm efficiency without depending on specific hardware or programming languages.

## Key Metrics in Algorithm Analysis
1. **Time Complexity** – How running time grows with input size.
2. **Space Complexity** – How memory usage grows with input size.
